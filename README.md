# Expo React Native Starter 🎉

This is a starter kit for [Expo](https://expo.io/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that includes all the tools you need to make native apps with React. It focuses on compatibility for web and Android, but should work for iOS too.

It includes an opinionated VS Code settings and recommended extensions. Try them. You'll probably like them 👨🏾‍💻.

TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier is there for code quality (integrated and automated via the aforementioned settings). We also have React Native Testing Library. This will not test any native Android, but can be used for testing React Native components in the browser, which, combined with TS should be enough to catch most bugs.

It's using Expo Router and [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) for UI.

You'll need additional stuff on your 💻 such as `watchman` and Android SDK. Follow the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) to get started.
